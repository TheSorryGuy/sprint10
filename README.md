```
- use 'npm run build' in your terminal, to make bundle. it will be created in '/dist' folder inside main project folder
- use 'npm run dev' to start local server and open it in your browser. enabled quick reload
- use 'npm run deploy' to upload site on github with gh-pages **dont forget** to change link in package.json/homepage. you also can reconfigure it to upload site on other servers (i guess, i'm still studying)
